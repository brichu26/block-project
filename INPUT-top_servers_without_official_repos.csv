Terraform Registry,https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/thrashr888-terraform-registry,https://github.com/thrashr888/terraform-mcp-server,thrashr888,terraform-mcp-server,101,8563.0,"This MCP server implementation provides tools for interacting with the Terraform Registry API, enabling AI agents to query provider information, resource details, module metadata, and generate example configurations. Developed by Paul Thrasher, it offers functionalities such as provider lookup, resource usage examples, module recommendations, data source lookup, and schema details retrieval. Built with TypeScript and leveraging the Model Context Protocol SDK, the server is particularly useful for AI applications that need to automate Terraform-related tasks, assist in infrastructure-as-code development, or provide intelligent suggestions for Terraform configurations."
Lokka (Microsoft Graph),https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/merill-lokka,https://github.com/merill/lokka/tree/HEAD/src/mcp,merill,lokka,100,4493.0,"Lokka is an MCP server that provides a bridge between AI assistants and Microsoft Graph API, enabling natural language interaction with Microsoft 365 tenants. Developed by Merill Fernando, it allows users to query and manage their Microsoft environment through simple conversational prompts rather than complex API calls. The server authenticates with Microsoft Entra using client credentials, translates natural language requests into appropriate Graph API calls, and returns formatted results. Particularly valuable for administrators who need to perform tasks like creating security groups, reviewing conditional access policies, or managing Intune configurations without leaving their AI assistant interface."
Telegram,https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/chigwell-telegram,https://github.com/chigwell/telegram-mcp,chigwell,telegram-mcp,99,,"Telegram MCP Server provides a bridge between Claude and Telegram messaging, enabling direct interaction with Telegram chats without leaving the conversation interface. Built using Python, Telethon, and the MCP Python SDK, it exposes three core tools: retrieving chat lists, fetching messages from specific chats, and sending messages to contacts. The implementation authenticates with the Telegram API using credentials stored in environment variables and integrates seamlessly with Claude Desktop through a simple configuration. Particularly valuable for users who want to monitor or participate in Telegram conversations while working with Claude."
AWS Lambda,https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/danilop-aws-lambda,https://github.com/danilop/mcp2lambda,danilop,mcp2lambda,99,,"MCP2Lambda enables Large Language Models to interact with AWS Lambda functions as tools without code changes. It acts as a bridge between MCP clients and Lambda functions, allowing models to access private resources, interact with AWS services, and leverage Lambda's capabilities for data processing and external API access. The implementation includes autodiscovery of Lambda functions and secure invocation, making it useful for extending AI capabilities in enterprise environments with existing AWS infrastructure."
