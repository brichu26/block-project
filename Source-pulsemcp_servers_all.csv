Built with TypeScript and the Model Context Protocol SDK, it enables AI assistants to retrieve and display encyclopedia entries directly within conversations. The implementation uses Axios for API requests and includes environment variable configuration for customization. This tool is particularly valuable for workflows requiring access to Chinese-language reference information without leaving the conversation interface."
Kusto (Azure Data Explorer),https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/zzzhdw-kusto,https://github.com/zzzhdw/mcp-server-kusto,zzzhdw,mcp-server-kusto,0,,"This MCP server for Azure Data Explorer (ADX), developed by zzzhdw, provides AI assistants with read-only access to ADX clusters. It offers tools for listing tables, executing queries, and retrieving schema information for both internal and external tables as well as materialized views. Built with Python and leveraging the azure-kusto-data library, it abstracts the complexities of ADX interactions, allowing AI systems to easily incorporate powerful data exploration and analysis capabilities. The server supports local emulator usage and implements authentication options for production environments. It's particularly useful for data analysts, researchers, and developers working with large-scale telemetry data, enabling use cases like log analysis, time series exploration, and real-time data querying in ADX environments."
