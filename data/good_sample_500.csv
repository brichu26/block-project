shibayu36,mysql-schema-explorer-mcp,1.0,,"MySQL Schema Explorer MCP provides a Go-based server that allows AI assistants to explore and interact with MySQL database schemas. Built by shibayu36, this implementation connects to MySQL databases to expose table structures, relationships, and metadata as MCP resources, making it valuable for database documentation, query building, and schema analysis tasks. The server leverages the mcp-go library to handle protocol communication while using the MySQL driver to extract schema information, enabling AI assistants to understand database architecture without direct database access."
jonathanfischer97,juliadoc-mcp,4.0,,"This Julia Documentation MCP server, developed by the ModelContextProtocol team, provides access to Julia's documentation and source code through Claude Desktop. Built with TypeScript and leveraging the Model Context Protocol SDK, it offers tools for retrieving documentation and source code for Julia packages, modules, types, functions, and methods. The implementation features built-in caching with a 5-minute TTL and proper error handling for Julia-specific issues. It's particularly useful for developers and data scientists working with Julia who need quick access to documentation and source code within their AI workflows, enabling use cases like code exploration, function reference, and interactive learning without switching contexts."
jmanhype,mcp-flux-studio,14.0,,"MCP Flux Studio bridges Flux's advanced image generation capabilities to AI coding assistants in Cursor and Windsurf (Codeium) IDEs. This TypeScript server implementation exposes four tools through the Model Context Protocol: text-to-image generation, image-to-image transformation, inpainting with customizable masks, and structural control generation (canny, depth, pose). It works by translating MCP tool calls into commands for the Flux CLI, executing them via Python, and returning the results to the IDE. Particularly valuable for developers who need to generate or manipulate images directly within their coding workflow without switching contexts."
syedazharmbnr1,claude-chatgpt-mcp,637.0,,"This MCP server implementation provides a bridge between Claude and the ChatGPT desktop app on macOS. Developed by Syed Azhar, it utilizes AppleScript to interact with the ChatGPT interface, allowing Claude to send prompts, retrieve responses, and manage conversations. The tool is designed for use cases where integration between different AI assistants is needed, such as comparing outputs or leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities within Claude's workflow."
smhnkmr,realtime-crypto-mcp-server,1.0,166.0,"Realtime Crypto MCP Server provides cryptocurrency data through the CoinCap API, offering two main tools: one for retrieving detailed exchange information and another for getting current cryptocurrency rates. The server runs on stdio transport and implements robust error handling and rate limiting with automatic retries. Built with TypeScript and the Model Context Protocol SDK, it enables AI assistants to access up-to-date cryptocurrency market data for applications requiring real-time financial information."
bacoco,ai-expert-workflow-mcp,6.0,1549.0,"AI Expert Workflow MCP is a server implementation that facilitates structured collaboration with AI experts in product development. Developed by bacoco, it provides access to three specialized AI roles: Product Manager, UX Designer, and Software Architect, each generating comprehensive documentation based on user requirements. The server uses OpenRouter API for flexible model selection and includes Task Master integration for converting product requirements into actionable development tasks. This implementation is particularly valuable for teams seeking to streamline the planning-to-implementation pipeline through expert consultation and document generation."
infinitiq-tech,mcp-jira,1.0,,"A Jira MCP server that enables AI assistants to interact with Jira's REST API through natural language commands. Built by InfinitIQ Tech, this implementation provides tools for managing projects, issues, and workflows including getting project details, searching issues with JQL, creating and transitioning tickets, and adding comments. The server supports multiple authentication methods for both Jira Cloud and Server/Data Center installations, making it valuable for software development teams who want to integrate Jira task management directly into their AI assistant workflows without switching contexts."
