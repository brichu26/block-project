Key Features
Unified Data Gateway
MindsDB acts as a unified data gateway that handles complex data operations, freeing AI apps and agents from the need to manage individual data sources or write complex logic. MindsDB enables “one-step” querying across multiple sources with full auditability.

Superior User Experience
MindsDB delivers a polished, secure, and user-friendly experience on top of MCP integrations. Our turnkey solution includes robust security controls, monitoring, governance, and native integrations to ensure compatibility with non-MCP solutions and applications.

Advanced AI Workflows
MindsDB orchestrates complex AI workflows, such as joining data from multiple sources and coordinating across various models and data systems in a single query. These composite workflows are challenging to implement using MCP alone."
